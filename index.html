    <p>Hello! I'm Mckenna Missfeldt. Welcome to my portfolio! After 5 years working as a research scientist, I decided to start a new journey as a Web Developr. </p>
    <p>I have a vast majority of different types of interests which include; rugby, brewing beer, fashion, and hanging out with my dog.</p>
    <p>I worked for 5 years designing and developing different types of pharmacological experiments to supress various types of genes that were known to cause cancer. Through this, I found that creativity has always been my strong suit. I think critical, practical, and I'll get the job done. </p>
